# tachiyomi-convert
tachiyomi-convert is a simple shell script to convert manga/comic chapters that are downloaded from the tachiyomi app, into .cbz files , and it also renames all the output .cbz file to display only the Volume and Chapter number

# P.S: This script is very basic and sometimes stuff like renaming doesn't work properly and you get stuff with the wrong name. Please keep in mind this is a very basic and a work in progress script
